üìã Extra info
These are time window based on previous drops and their patterns.
This is mainly so you can be better prepared for a drop and when it‚Äôs a good
idea to keep a closer eye out for certain retailers. These stores usually stick
to a pattern, sometimes they will change patterns after awhile but they usually
stick to the same pattern for awhile. (If they change up their pattern I‚Äôll edit
this post).

How frequently they drop really just depends on when they get their stock in.
Could be once a week, once every two weeks, or once every three weeks.
The days they drop usually stay pretty consistent but how long between drops
really just depends on if they are getting stock in. For example: Best Buy use
to drop every two weeks but currently has been been dropping every week because
they are getting more stock in.
For tips on actually checking out at each retailer,
make sure to check the announcements in this group for the YouTube videos by
Jake Randall for each retailer. Each retailer has their own video because each
store has a different checkout process.
Knowing how to check out at each store beforehand is a huge advantage and
I highly recommend the videos.
